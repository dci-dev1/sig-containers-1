# Overcome Kubernetes cost management challenges with FinOps best practices

FinOps practitioners know that the cloud only gets more complicated from here, and that having strong cloud financial management practices eases how we report on and allocate costs.

This whitepaper outlined some strong foundational steps to start increasing the accuracy of how your teams report on container costs. Within this paper, we covered:

* **Inform:** How the public cloud providers charge for their Kubernetes services. We reviewed why performing chargeback and cost allocation in environments with Kubernetes is challenging.
* **Optimize:** How to continuously look for ways to optimize your Kubernetes clusters and pods, and recommended a few tactics to test.
* **Operate:** We outlined a few approaches to container cost allocation and build policies to govern container spending, and how to integrate tooling to help manage container costs alongside traditional cloud spending. We also reviewed different types of tooling that can help your teams build cloud finance policies, tracking, and governance.

As more users adopt and put containers and Kubernetes to work, new best practices form around tracking both utilization and finance data. This means our Finops lens on containers is constantly changing and evolving.

## Join our community
Get a deeper dive into unwinding container cost and utilization data by joining the FinOps Foundation community. Members are constantly discussing container and Kubernetes best practices and sharing new tips and tricks. The #finops-on-kubernetes Slack room is a great place to join the conversation, you’ll get a link to join once your membership is approved.

## Check back and contribute your expertise
We invite any FinOps practitioner to check back for updates and contribute to the conversation by either joining our Community or checking out our various GitHub repos to lend your expertise.
